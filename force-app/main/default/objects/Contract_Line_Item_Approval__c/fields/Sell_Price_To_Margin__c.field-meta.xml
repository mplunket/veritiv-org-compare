    <description>This field to capture key details for decisioning on the CLIA page layout. Originally named Start Target Floor. Per Rob on 10/2, &quot;A like message would be used for the “Sell Price to Margin”.  However, we would need a Calculation.  The Calculation needed would be Margin percent.  So here is the calc:

 

Sales Rep Proposed Price

Minus

Current Commissionable Cost

Divided by

Sales Rep Proposed Price

 

EXAMPLE (103-100)/103 = .029126 or .03 (when rounded to the second decimal)

 

If Minimum Margin was 10% using the above examples we would trigger a message of “Less Than Margin Min”&quot;</description>

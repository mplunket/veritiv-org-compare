    <description>NB 09/14/2017: This learning tab is being used to replace the tab that the Sales Reps used to access Learning through Brainshark. Now that trainings will be administered through VKS this tab loads an internally hosted (by Brand Marketing team) splash page that contains a link to MyHR. The reps will use this to navigate to MyHR and then log into VKS from there.</description>
